# HangMan

Simple HangMan game where users only have 4 incorrect tries until the game is over. The game first prompts the user to provide a word for the game to begin. Once the word is given, the word is inserted into a linked list where every letter in the word and the boolean value "false" is assigned to a node in the list. The game prints out the word but inserts a "*" instead of the letter. The game then prompts the user to provide a letter guess and searches the linked list for the given letter. If the letter is found, the matched value inside of the node is set to true. If the letter is not found, the player loses one try. The game prints the list again but replaces the "*" with the letter value in the node if the letter was guessed correctly. The game loops this until the game is either won or the player incorrectly guesses 4 times. The game then asks the player to play again.
